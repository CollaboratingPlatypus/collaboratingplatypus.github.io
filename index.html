                Introduction
              </h3>
              <p>Founded in 2015 by a group of contracting developers working together for the RSPCA in Australia. Collaborating Platypus aims to be a group of like-minded developers who don’t take themselves too seriously, are up for a little fun and friendly banter, want work on or contribute to open source projects, and would consider forming partnerships with various other members in group to pursue commercial endeavours.</p>

                How to join
              </h3>
              <p>Would you like to join us? We’re open to applications. However, there’s a few hoops you’ll need to jump through. Please don’t be disappointed if you don’t make it on the team. Our first priority is to the keep the team tight, happy, and together. Still interested? Well as you can imagine there’s a small but easy vetting process. In true open source and developer orientated style, you’ll need to fork our code of conduct, add your name to it, and then send a pull request. You’ll need at least two of the founding members to give you the ok. If the pull request is accepted, you’re on the team. It’s that easy. If you don’t make it or you’re not interested in joining, but still would like to contribute, then fork any projects under our control and fire pull requests away!</p>

                Key Projects
              </h3>
              <p>It’s still early days for us, so there’s not too much to say about our key projects. However, we’re working away and we hope fill this space with glorious open source gold soon.</p>

                Donating a Project
              </h3>
              <p>Do you have a kick ass project or project that needs a little love? We’re interested in taking on projects where the maintainer doesn’t have enough time to review code, merge pull requests, build, deploy to Nuget, or etc. If this is you, please feel free to contact us to discuss potential options.</p>

              <p class="clearfix bio"><a href="https://github.com/pleb">Wade Baglin (AKA Pleb)</a> - Obsessive compulsive problem solver – is there such a condition? This guy can be a little crazy and his jokes can be pretty far out there, but he sure does get a laugh or two. Is very open about hating ORMs and loving Micro ORMs, and lot of his rants are about this love hate relationship. Did we mention he cuts respectable lines of code?</p>
              <a href="https://github.com/MooseMagnet" class="profile-pic"><span style="background:url(https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/7224540?v=3&s=82) no-repeat center center"><img src="https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7224540?v=3&s=80" style="opacity: 0;"></span></a>
              <p class="clearfix bio"><a href="https://github.com/MooseMagnet">Ryan Hayward (AKA MooseMagnet)</a> - What's there to say about this guy? Heaps actually. Feature complete with voices, impersonations, and witty humour make for a fun guy. Did I mention his coding and knowledge is AAA+++. No? Well it is. Although, and this is hard for me to write, he does know a little too much about SharePoint. Can we forgive?</p> 
              <a href="https://github.com/jezza323" class="profile-pic"><span style="background:url(https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/8828643?v=3&s=82) no-repeat center center"><img src="https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/8828643?v=3&s=80" style="opacity: 0;"></span></a>
              <p class="clearfix bio"><a href="https://github.com/jezza323">Jeremy Drice (AKA jezza323)</a> - According to book of Germy, there’s are only two types of people in this world. Those who cycle and those who don’t. Germy of course is in the former group. However, when not pushing and pulling on peddles you’ll find this guy buried in code and tinkering with something. A great asset to any team and a walking book of knowledge. He’s the only person I know with a Windows phone, so he’s got plenty of time of his hands as none is taken by those pesky apps. Windows phone LOL.</p>
              <a href="https://github.com/ch00nz" class="profile-pic"><span style="background:url(https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5841316?v=3&s=82) no-repeat center center"><img src="https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5841316?v=3&s=80" style="opacity: 0;"></span></a>
              <p class="clearfix bio"><a href="https://github.com/ch00nz">Anthony Leiper (AKA ch00nz)</a> - When he’s not thinking of new app ideas or correcting other people’s speeling (this will drive him nuts) mistakes, he’s writing and working on software. Don’t talk down about his beloved Firefox or Thunderbird mail client (what year is this) else you’ll release the kraken. All in all a genuine good guy who’s easy to work with and super fun to be around. Lastly, he's not a huge fan of a few recent MS decisions concerning UI design for PC and Xbox – I dare you to ask!</p>
